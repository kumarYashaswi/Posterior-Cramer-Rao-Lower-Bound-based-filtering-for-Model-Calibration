# Posterior-Cramer-Rao-Lower-Bound-based-filtering-for-Model-Calibration
Code for performing parameter and volatility calibration S&P 500 prices using Heston Model.   
Implemented Extended Kalman Filter, Unscented Kalman Filter and Particle filter along with first of a kind algorithm for Heston Model Calibration- a particle filter approximated Posterior Cramer-Rao Lower Bound for selecting the most optimal filter at each time-step
and sequential update through Normal Maximum Likelihood Estimation
